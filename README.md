The testing images are all background-removed by [Adobe Express](https://express.adobe.com/tools/remove-background).

### Results

1. French Lady v2, 2k, AI generated

2. French Lady v1, 2k, AI generated

3. Old men, 1k, AI generated, from [CIVITAI](https://civitai.com/images/1318029?modelVersionId=105035&prioritizedUserIds=81744&period=AllTime&sort=Most+Reactions&limit=20)

4. Eponine in Les Misérables, still, from [Internet](https://movie.douban.com/photos/photo/1855235220/#title-anchor)

The first three results are all generated from AI-generated images, while the last one is a real photograph. It seems that PIFuHD has a bad performance on AI-generated images.

## 2. ZoeDepth

- [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11z58bl3meSzo6kFqkahMa35G5jmh2Wgt?usp=sharing)

The testing images are all background-removed by [Adobe Express](https://express.adobe.com/tools/remove-background).

### Results

The output is viewed using a [online glTF viewer](https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/) that allows custom lighting.

From the above results, the following conclusions can be drawn:
- ZoeDepth works much better on converting 2D images to 3D models than PIFuHD.
- ZoeDepth only cares about the details in the image, no matter if it's a real photograph or an AI-generated image (This differs a lot from PIFuHD which has a very bad performance on AI-generated images).
- The resolution of ZeoDepth is satisfying and depends on lighting and quality of the original image.
- Though the generated model in the glTF viewer looks a little bit "pale", we can always change the lighting later in game engines
- The 3D model generated by ZoeDepth looks the best when viewed from the same angle as the image. In other words, when viewed from a different perspective, the model is still not so realistic.
